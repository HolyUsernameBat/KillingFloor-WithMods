I used [Benjamin Wharton](https://app.assembla.com/profile/BenjaminWharton)'s [repo](https://app.assembla.com/spaces/killingfloorsource/subversion/source) to retrieve some of the patches. And used [BatchExportCommandlet](https://wiki.beyondunreal.com/Legacy:BatchExportCommandlet) to get the latest scripts from version 1065 game packages.
